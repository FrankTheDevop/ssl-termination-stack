# ssl-termination-stack
This is an example definition for a SSL Terminating Stack using Docker, LetÂ´s encrypt, HAProxy. It is divided into a generator Stack definiton and a worker stack definition where you can put your web app

It is based on the work of ixc/ixc-acme.sh (https://github.com/ixc/ixc-acme.sh), so all credits go to them.
I just completed and adapted to my own needs to reuse for multiple projects and to make it easier and quicker for others to add SSL Termination to their stack.
