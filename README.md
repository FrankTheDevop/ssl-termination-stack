# ssl-termination-stack
This is an example definition for a SSL Terminating Stack using Docker, Let´s encrypt, HAProxy. It is divided into a generator Stack definiton and a worker stack definition where you can put your web app

It is based on the work of ixc/ixc-acme.sh (https://github.com/ixc/ixc-acme.sh), just completed and adapted to my own needs to reuse for multiple projects
